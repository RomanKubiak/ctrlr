Luabind |version| documentation
===============================

This is the documentation for Luabind |release|.

Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and Lua. It
has the ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, to Lua.
It will also supply the functionality to define classes in Lua and let them
derive from other Lua classes or C++ classes. Lua classes can override virtual
functions from their C++ base classes. It is written towards Lua 5.2 but
should also work with 5.1.
