luabind for Debian
------------------

 * Added a pkg-config file
 Here is an example of how it is used:

 gcc -o test test.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags luabind`

 * Some example cleaning
 Examples needed new Makefiles and some README fixes, and all is applied
 by patch (02_example_cleaning.diff) too.
